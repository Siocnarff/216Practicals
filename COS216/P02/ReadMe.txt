You can test the website by opening any of the .html files in Firefox or Chrome.


General:
Since not one API provides consistent star ratings for songs I have used
a random number generator to create the ratings.

New Releases: 
Since I could not find any API that provides appropriate song reviews I used a quotation API to 
provide the "reviews" in the tooltips.

Featured Page: 
Click on the album art to play each song sample.

Bonus Marks:
Notice that the calendar is clickable and that once a song has been selected you can play the sample by clicking
on the cover art. Please note that the API sometimes provides an empty audio file, especially with very new songs, so
please try to test the functionality on more than one album.

Best Regards.
And good luck with marking during Lockdown!
